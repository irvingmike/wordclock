# Word Clock
This is just a little project I did to work on my knowledge of AngularJS. It is far from done, but right now it is functional.

My goal would be to make it so that you could include include it in a webpage with a single tag and ti would scale to the size of it's container. 

## TODO List:
1) Just type to scale with size.
2) Move settings to JSON file to make it somethings easily changeable.
3) Add settings bar to bottom to be able to change things like:
   * Font color, both dimmed and lit
   * Background color (Photo?)
   * toggle birthday wish
   * toggle glow on illuminated characters
   
Very new to AngularJS, and constructive criticism is always welcome.
